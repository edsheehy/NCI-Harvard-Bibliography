NCI-Harvard-Bibliography
========================

Here is a modified version of the default Harvard XSLT bibliography stylesheet that comes with MS Word 2010 and MS Word 2013.
Changes have been made to the stylesheet so that the bibliography follows the National College of Ireland's version of the Harvard style.

Here is a link to the NIC's guide to their version of the Harvard style.

This file needs to be copied to the correct folder in your Office installation.  On my machine this folder was
C:\Users\Ed\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style

Normally the 'AppData' folder is hidden.  I had to change the 'view' settings on my 'users' folder to 'show hidden items'.
 
If it is copied to the correct location, an extra style option should appear in the drop down list in the 'Citations & Bibliography' section under the 'References' tab on the MS Word tool bar.

*** Warning ***
Use this stylesheet as a template.  There may be some errors in the format, and you will need to review the output.
All feedback is welcome.
