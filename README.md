NCI-Harvard-Bibliography
========================

Here is a modified version of the default Harvard XSLT bibliography stylesheet that comes with Word 2013.
Changes have been made to the stylesheet so that the bibliography follows the National College of Ireland's version of the Harvard style.
 
This file needs to be copied to the correct folder in your Office installation.  On my machine this folder was
C:\Users\Ed\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style
 
If it is copied to the correct location the an extra style should appear in the drop down list in the 'Citations & Bibliography' section under the 'References' tab on the tool bar.
